## run file = this executable file = is the first entry point to your app, 1st file that gets run
#therefore we need a way of linking our dependencies = require_relative + require_relative
# dependencies =(what your project depends on to run ex: gems/files you need access to )

#require_relative = i know where the file I need is compared to where
# i currently am in my app, so im gonna give a file path thats relative to the file I'm in
# use if you know exactly where your gem is relative to your current project
##require = works with absolute path, use if you need a gem thats installed in my sistem but you don't know where your gem is or lives (determined in my shell path)

#use require_relative for this project = im gonna require .env file bc 
#i know exactly where it relative to the current file that im in 
# up a level/ up 1 folder into lib foler = .. 
#and lets access that .env file
